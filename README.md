# Voting-Bot

This is a python bot to automate the voting process for a teacher in a contest.
It uses Selenium to dynamically load data and enter said data into the proper fields.
The program won't work anymore, as the website no longer exists.
This was written in 2020, so the Selenium code may need to be updated.
